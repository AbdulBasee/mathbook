# liblouis add-on symbol table for PreTeXt-generated HTML
#
# History:
#   2019-06-30: Initiated


# As suggested by Alexei Kolesnikov, this file
# translates more exotic Unicode characters
# generated by PreTeXt's HTML conversion into
# Braille dot patterns

# Identical definitions are resolved by the *first*
# definition, so to overide a stock defintion, we
# have this table come first by including the English
# UEB Grade 2 table as its last act (see bottom).
#
# Full chain of includes is:
#
# pretext-symbol.dis
# en-ueb-g2.ctb
# en-ueb-g1.ctb
# en-ueb-chardefs.uti (lots of different constructions)
# latinLetterDef8Dots.uti (Latin letters, 6-dot lower and 8-dot upper with capital indicator)
# en-ueb-math.ctb
# braille-patterns.cti (256 Unicode characters mapping to 8-dot patterns)

# See "2.8 Translation Opcodes" in
# "Liblouis User's and Programmer's Manual" for
# codes like "punctuation" and  "begword"

# PTX: ldblbracket, rdblbracket, dblbrackets
# Unicode:
# MATHEMATICAL LEFT WHITE SQUARE BRACKET, x27e6
# MATHEMATICAL RIGHT WHITE SQUARE BRACKET, x27e7
# Translation:  [[, ]]
