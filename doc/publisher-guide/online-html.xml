<chapter xml:id="online-html">
    <title>Conversion to Online HTML</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>Similar to the case for <latex /> conversion (<xref ref="pdf-print"/>) there is a variety of command-line processing parameters available (<xref ref="processing-parameters" />).  Until we are ready to document these carefully, open <c>xsl/mathbook-html.xsl</c> and poke around to see what is available.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section xml:id="knowled-content">
        <title>Knowled Content</title>

        <p>We knowl examples, proofs, and inline exercises by default, mostly so a new author discovers that this presentation is an option.  The knowlization of items can be controlled by a variety of command-line processing parameters (<xref ref="processing-parameters" />).  While these are in flux, we do not list them here, but instead suggest you open <c>xsl/mathbook-html.xsl</c> and search on <c>html.knowl</c> to see what is available.</p>

        <p>Note that some of these switches are for broad categories of items, for example, <c>html.knowl.theorem</c> will also knowl <tag>lemma</tag>s, <tag>corollary</tag>s, <tag>fact</tag>s, and more.  This choice applies document-wide, there is no plan to support electing this on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Lists</title>

        <p>On a description list (<tag>dl</tag>), only <attr>width</attr> values of <c>narrow</c> and <c>medium</c> are implemented. (2018-03-28)</p>

        <p>Lists with several columns are rendered in row-major order, as of 2018-02-28.  In other words, the first list items (<tag>li</tag>) in your source will populate the first row.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Styling</title>

        <introduction>
            <p>The PreTeXt conversion to <init>HTML</init> creates standard <init>HTML</init> elements, with styles controlled by <init>CSS</init> via class names (and not so much via the element names).  As evidence of this, building <init>HTML</init> without the accompanying Javascript and <init>CSS</init> renders in a readable fashion, albeit quite plain (as one would expect).  This section describes ways that a publisher can influence the style.</p>
        </introduction>

        <subsection>
            <title>Colors</title>

            <p>The processing parameter <c>html.css.colorfile</c> can be provided as the name of a file describing a color theme for <init>HTML</init> output.  It presumes the same server which serves the remainder of the <init>CSS</init> (<c>pretextbook.org</c> by default).  So for example,<cd>
                <cline>-stringparam html.css.colorfile colors_pastel_blue_orange.css</cline>
            </cd>will provide a softer look.  The default colors are contained in <c>colors_default.css</c>.  It is easy to inspect and compare these files to see what is involved in designing a color theme.  In particular, <c>colors_default.css</c> contains documentation on how to design a theme.</p>
        </subsection>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Analytics</title>
        <index>analytics</index>

        <p><pretext/> makes it as easy as possible to have services provide data about visitors to the <init>HTML</init> version of your book.  We support <url hef="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</url><fn><c>analytics.google.com/analytics/web/</c></fn> and <url hef="https://statcounter.com/">StatCounter</url><fn><c>statcounter.com/</c></fn>.</p>

        <p>In each case, use is similar.  Begin at the service's site and follow their instructions for enabling data collection for your book's site.  We will not document those instructions here.  When completed, you can request (or will be shown) sample Javascript code to add to pages on your site.  Except, <pretext/> is going to do that part for you.  You only need to provide the unique identifiers used by the service that identify your project.  Because these sign-ups are dependent on your site, this is a publisher activity, and hence configured with command-line parameters (<xref ref="processing-parameters"/>).</p>

        <p>StatCounter uses two identifiers, a <c>project</c> ID and a <c>security</c> code.  You can find them in your <q>Project Config</q> under <q>Settings</q>.  Or the code provided will contain lines such as<cd>
            <cline>var sc_project=11538430;</cline>
            <cline>var sc_invisible=1;</cline>
            <cline>var sc_security="72e1390a";</cline>
        </cd>In which case you would use two command-line switches:<cd>
            <cline>-stringparam html.statcounter.project 11538430</cline>
            <cline>-stringparam html.statcounter.security 72e1390a</cline>
        </cd></p>

        <p>Google Analytics comes in two flavors, Classic and Universal.  You will be given a single ID, which Google calls a tracking ID, which may also be called a property ID.  An example looks like <c>UA-6836004-1</c>.  In this case, you would use just one of the following two examples on your <c>xsltproc</c> command-line,<cd>
            <cline>-stringparam html.google-classic UA-6836004-1</cline>
            <cline>-stringparam html.google-universal UA-6836004-1</cline>
        </cd></p>

        <p>We would be happy to provide support for additional major services.  Just make a feature request.</p>
